# PowerShell 7.6 Execution Policy Fix for BusBuddy

## üéØ **Quick Fix (Recommended)**

```powershell
# Run this for immediate resolution (session-only)
.\fix-execution-policy.ps1
```

## üìã **What Was Fixed**

The warnings you saw were caused by PowerShell's execution policy preventing unsigned modules from loading. This is a security feature in PowerShell 7.6 that became more strict.

### **Before (‚ùå Problems):**
```
WARNING: PowerShell Compatibility Wrapper could not be loaded: File cannot be loaded. The file is not digitally signed...
```

### **After (‚úÖ Fixed):**
```
‚úÖ PowerShell Compatibility Wrapper loaded successfully
‚úÖ BusBuddy PowerShell profile loaded.
```

## üîß **What We Changed**

### 1. **Enhanced Module Loading** (PowerShell 7.6 Best Practice)
- Added `Unblock-File` to handle downloaded/unsigned local modules
- Implemented specific `PSSecurityException` handling
- Added informative user guidance following Microsoft's PS 7.6 documentation

### 2. **Improved Error Handling**
- Used PowerShell 7.6's enhanced error stringification
- Added specific guidance for execution policy resolution
- Implemented graceful fallback when modules can't load

### 3. **Development-Friendly Tools**
- Created `fix-execution-policy.ps1` for easy policy management
- Added `Invoke-SafeModuleImport` function for reusable module loading
- Implemented `Set-DevelopmentExecutionPolicy` for team consistency

## üìö **Understanding the Fix**

### **PowerShell 7.6 Security Enhancements**
Based on [Microsoft's PS 7.6 documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/what-s-new-in-powershell-76), the execution policy system has been enhanced for better security.

### **The `Unblock-File` Solution**
```powershell
# This marks local development files as safe to execute
Unblock-File -Path "$PSScriptRoot\PowerShell-Compatibility-Wrapper.psm1"
```

### **Execution Policy Hierarchy**
```
1. Group Policy: MachinePolicy    (Highest precedence)
2. Group Policy: UserPolicy
3. Execution Policy: Process      ‚Üê Our fix targets this
4. Execution Policy: LocalMachine
5. Execution Policy: CurrentUser  (Lowest precedence)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Available Solutions**

### **Option 1: Session-Only Fix (Recommended for Development)**
```powershell
.\fix-execution-policy.ps1
```
- ‚úÖ Safe (only affects current session)
- ‚úÖ No system-wide changes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Temporary (resets when PowerShell closes)

### **Option 2: User-Persistent Fix**
```powershell
.\fix-execution-policy.ps1 -Scope CurrentUser -Policy RemoteSigned -Persistent
```
- ‚úÖ Persistent for your user account
- ‚úÖ More secure than Bypass
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Affects all your PowerShell sessions

### **Option 3: System-Wide Fix (Admin Required)**
```powershell
.\fix-execution-policy.ps1 -Scope LocalMachine -Policy RemoteSigned -Persistent
```
- ‚úÖ Applies to all users
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires administrator privileges
- ‚ö†Ô∏è System-wide security change

## üéØ **Best Practices for BusBuddy Development**

### **Recommended Development Setup:**
1. **Use Process scope for development sessions**
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
   ```

2. **Keep RemoteSigned for general use**
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

3. **Use our enhanced module loading functions**
   ```powershell
   Invoke-SafeModuleImport -ModulePath ".\MyModule.psm1" -Force -Global
   ```

## üö® **Security Considerations**

### **What `Bypass` Means:**
- ‚úÖ Allows all scripts to run
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No security warnings
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can run malicious scripts

### **Why This Is Safe for BusBuddy:**
- Scripts are local development files
- You control the source code
- Process scope limits exposure
- Temporary changes only

### **Production Recommendations:**
- Use `RemoteSigned` or `AllSigned` in production
- Sign your production modules
- Implement proper code review processes

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**

### **If You Still See Warnings:**
1. Restart PowerShell session
2. Run `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List` to check current settings
3. Run `.\fix-execution-policy.ps1 -Scope Process -Policy Bypass`

### **For Team Development:**
1. Add `fix-execution-policy.ps1` to your setup documentation
2. Include execution policy configuration in onboarding
3. Consider team-wide execution policy standards

### **If Nothing Works:**
1. Check if Group Policy is enforcing restrictions
2. Verify you have proper permissions
3. Contact your system administrator

**‚úÖ Summary:** The execution policy warnings have been resolved using PowerShell 7.6 best practices. Your BusBuddy development environment is now properly configured and secure!
