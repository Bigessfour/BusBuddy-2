# Using Tavily Expert MCP in VS Code

Now that you've restarted VS Code with the proper configuration, here's how to use the Tavily Expert MCP:

## Accessing Tavily Expert MCP

1. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` or click the Copilot Chat icon in the sidebar
   - You should see the chat interface open

2. **Begin typing a question**
   - Start composing a message in the chat
   - The MCP selector should appear as you type
   - Look for a dropdown, menu, or icon near the input area

3. **Select Tavily Expert**
   - From the MCP options, select "Tavily Expert"
   - This will route your query through the Tavily search and retrieval system

## Recommended Questions for Testing

Try these questions to test if Tavily Expert is working properly:

1. "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
2. "Summarize the current state of AI regulation in the EU"
3. "What are the most recent trends in software development for 2025?"

## Troubleshooting the MCP Selector

If you don't see the MCP selector:

- **Try alternative locations**: Look for a dropdown or icon near your input field, in the toolbar, or in the sidebar
- **Look after typing**: Some interfaces only show the MCP selector after you've typed something
- **Check for a settings gear**: Click on settings icons to see if MCP options appear there
- **Try an explicit command**: Type a slash command like `/mcp` to see if it triggers MCP options

## Visual Indicators

When Tavily Expert is active, you might see:

- A small icon or label showing "Tavily Expert" is selected
- Different formatting for responses that come from the Tavily system
- Possible attribution for search results in the responses

The Tavily Expert MCP should enhance your Copilot Chat experience with up-to-date information from the web and improved search capabilities!
